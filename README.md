# FinOOProgram
Description:
  This is the final project of Tad in Jason Jenkins object Oriented design class. 

files needed:
  The only files needed to run are the application files, the setup, and the final project appliction or just download the compressed fin OO file as it is those files in a zip.

  The folders labed 1-10 or old versions of the program and where copied as checkpoints where met. Each name tells broadly what was added in the version.

How to run:
  1)Make sure that application files, setup, and final project are all in one folder
  2)run the setup and accept defeaults
  -windows is going to give you security warning but there shouldent be a problem
  3)Now run the Final Project app and it should boot up the game

How to play:
  On start up, you are going to see a map with ted cruz and qustion marks
  Drag ted cruz over the check marks directly above you, not too far above though
  another window should open and either combat or a shop should apear
  
  combat should be self explanitory exept for the 'love button'
  The love button shows you what items you can use when clicked and when clicking on the buttons that apear, they do stuff

  Once Ted Cruz is near the top, the final boss will apear on the map

  dragging ted over the boss will open a shop and once leaving the shop, you can fight the boss

  If you win, you get to keep playing as the same person with the same stats and items
  If you loss, you will loss


  Potential Problem:
    If you hit the x on the top instead of the quit button, the curent application will close but the orginal application will keep running in the background and won't close unless you task manager it or someother way.

  Problem: If you already have the program installed somehwere else and you want to move it, you will have to go to your settings and uninstall the app and then run the setup again in order for the game to run.
